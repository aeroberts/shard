Test that messages are moved from the message queue of an Old Shard to a New Shard when an ADD_SHARD command
changes the keyspace of the old shard and messages in Old Shard's message queue are no longer for that shard.

# Client 2,3,4 should receive response
# Client 1 will not receive a response because we have blocked all messages from master -> cluster 1
# and we need a response from cluster 1 before we can requeue the message in flight to cluster 1
