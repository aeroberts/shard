Tests that if a master drops a response to a client linerizability is still held, and that
the client's whose message was dropped will retry after timeout

# Start single paxos cluster
python paxos/send.py 1 0 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0
python paxos/send.py 1 1 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0
python paxos/send.py 1 2 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0

# Start master with -fc flag to drop first occurence of x from master to client
python startMaster.py config/master/singleNodeLocal -fc x

# To run, use the following bash script (performs below actions)
bash tests/dropMasterToClient/run.sh

# Start two clients
python startClient config/client/clientLocal
python startClient config/client/clientLocal

# Send put x 2 on client one
put x 2

# Send put x 3 on client two JUST AFTER client 1
put x 3

# Client 2 will receive a response, client 1 will timeout then receive response
# Run get x after client 1 times out
get x

# Cluster will execute put x 2, put x 3, put x 2, get x, returning x = 2
