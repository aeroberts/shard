Tests that if a paxos replica dies after sending SHARD_READY to master but BEFORE responding KEYS_LEAREND to
the old shard, that the old shard requesting process will timeout and resend to new shard, causing a view change

# Start original singal paxos cluster
python paxos/send.py 1 0 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0
python paxos/send.py 1 1 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0
python paxos/send.py 1 2 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0

# Start cluster to add with ONLY primary using -ksr (kill shard ready) flag
python paxos/send.py 1 0 config/replica/local2 -ksr
python paxos/send.py 1 1 config/replica/local2 
python paxos/send.py 1 2 config/replica/local2

# Put a couple puts on the original shard then call ADD_SHARD
python masterClient.py config/client/localClient -b tests/killAfterShardReady/putsAdd

# What should be observed is the primary for New Shard (second shard) dying, and the primary for
# Old Shard (first shard) timing out after a few seconds and rebroadcasting.  New Shard view changes
# but does not run paxos on BATCH_PUT again.
