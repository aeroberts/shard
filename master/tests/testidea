Start cluster 1, but have master send no messages from that MQ
client 1: put testKey2 one
client 2: put testKey2 two      <-- Should be first on MQ
client 3: get testKey2          <-- Should be second on MQ
client 4: put scooby doo        <-- Should be third on MQ
Start cluster 2
    Client 2 should receive response (testKey2, two)
    Client 3 should receive response (testKey2, two)
    Client 4 should receive response (scooby, doo)

    Client 1 should receive response (after timeout)
