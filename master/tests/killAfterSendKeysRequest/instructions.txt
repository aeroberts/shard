Tests that if primary dies after sending SEND_KEYS_REQUEST to Old Shard, that old shard times out and
ADD_SHARD process completes successfully (with response to client)

# Start original singal paxos cluster
python paxos/send.py 1 0 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0
python paxos/send.py 1 1 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0
python paxos/send.py 1 2 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0

# Start cluster to add with primary having -kskresp (kill send keys response) flag
python paxos/send.py 1 0 config/replica/local2 -kskreq

# Start master
python startMaster.py config/master/singleNodeLocal -ast

# Put a couple puts on the original shard then call ADD_SHARD
python masterClient.py config/client/clientLocal -b tests/killAfterShardReady/putsAdd

# What should be observed: Primary of New Shard dies after sending SEND_KEYS_REQUEST,
# The primary for Old Shard receives, creates a timeout process, and responds.
# The timeout process times out and rebroadcasts the SEND_KEYS_RESPONSE
# causing New Shard to view change, then run BATCH_PUT, then respond with SHARD_READY
# Finally, the client should receive a successful response
