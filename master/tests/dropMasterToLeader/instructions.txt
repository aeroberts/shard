Tests that linerizability is still held if a message is dropped from the master to the primary
and that no messages will progress until the first client times out

# Start single paxos cluster
python paxos/send.py 1 0 config/replica/local1 -n 1 -c 0

# Start master with -fl flag to drop first occurence of x from master to primary
python startMaster.py config/master/singleNodeLocal -fl x

# Start two clients
python startClient config/client/clientLocal
python startClient config/client/clientLocal

# Send put x 2 on client one
put x 2

# Send put x 3 on client two JUST AFTER client 1
put x 3

# Client 1 will timeout, causing a rebroadcast, then receive response.  Client 2 will then receive response.
# Run get x after client 2 receives resposne
get x

# Cluster will execute put x 2, put x 3, get x, returning x = 3
